## Bucket List

Create an application to make a 'bucket list' of countries you want to visit:

- Use the rest countries API to get the countries of the world.
- Add countries to a bucket list.
- Persist this list using Mongo.
- Try to split your client code into models and views. Think about the responsibilities of each.

Possible extensions:

- Add a Leaflet Map with markers for countries on the bucket list
- Add more detail to the bucket list items - e.g. landmarks you want to visit or the season you want to visit in. Persist these to Mongo too.
- Style the app
